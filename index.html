  <h2>Prisons Information on COVID-19</h2>
  <h3>What is being done to keep the public, staff, and offenders safe.</h3>
  <p class="description">COVID-19 case rates have been substantially higher and
    escalating much more rapidly in prisons than in the US
    population. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    represents a challenge to prisons because of close confinement,
    limited access to personal protective equipment, and elevated
    burden of cardiac and respiratory conditions that exacerbate
    COVID-19 risk among prisoners. The information presented below goes through all of the actions that have been taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 in NC prison systems. You can view these actions in reverse chronological order below.</p>

    <h1>April 20, 2020</h1>
    <p>Extending through May 3 the April 7 moratorium on the acceptance of offenders from the county jails, in effect a “stay at home” initiative. This extension was supported by the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association.
      Continuing for another 30 days, until May 16, the suspension of visitation, offender outside work assignments and offender home leaves. Legal and pastoral care visits will continue with medical screening. Also continuing are two free five-minute phone calls each week for offenders who are eligible for phone calls.
      Temporarily closing the Johnston Correctional Institution and transferring hundreds of offenders to other prisons to free the staff for reassignment to Neuse Correctional Institution, to help with managing that facility where a mass testing operation of the 700 offenders at Neuse Correctional Institution has revealed hundreds of offenders there are infected with COVID-19 and 98 percent are asymptomatic. The staff at Neuse Correctional have been working under intense conditions for more than two weeks, when the first two offenders there tested positive for COVID-19 on April 2.</p>
