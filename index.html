  <h2 class="title">Prisons Information on COVID-19</h2>
  <h3>What is being done to keep the public, staff, and offenders safe.</h3>
  <p class="description">COVID-19 case rates have been substantially higher and
    escalating much more rapidly in prisons than in the US
    population. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
    represents a challenge to prisons because of close confinement,
    limited access to personal protective equipment, and elevated
    burden of cardiac and respiratory conditions that exacerbate
    COVID-19 risk among prisoners. The information presented below goes through all of the actions that have been taken to combat the spread of COVID-19 in NC prison systems. You can view these actions in reverse chronological order below.</p>

    <h1>Nov 9, 2020</h1>
    <p>Initiated a staff COVID-19 testing regimen to weekly test five percent of the employees at every facility for COVID-19. This ongoing testing initiative will result in 20 percent of the staff at every prison facility being tested on a monthly basis. Any staff who tests positive for the virus will be off the job until he or she meets the Centers for Disease Control and North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services criteria to be considered presumed recovered from the virus. This testing effort will help to keep the staff healthy, their families safer from the virus, and will better protect our offender populations. Staff may continue to be tested on their own with no co-pays through a partnership with the State Health Plan, FastMed and LabCorp, which has been extended through the end of the year.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="circle">
    <h1>Sept 1, 2020</h1>
  <p>Resumed limited educational programs for eligible offenders, with no face-to-face instruction and continued implementation of all COVID-19 safety measures for classes from community colleges and other post-secondary education entities. Learning packets will be distributed for independent learning for high school equivalency, adult education, literacy and vocational training. Also, taped lectures from educators will be provided when available. Limited face-to-face instruction by Division of Prisons educators, with COVID-19 protocols in place, will resume for offenders assigned to high school equivalency classes.</p>

    <h1>July 30, 2020</h1>
    <p>  To date, COVID-19 mass testing has been completed at 39 prison facilities with results received on 12,524 offenders. Since the mass testing initiative got underway June 22, 2020, a total of 290 (1.4 percent) of offenders tested have positive results, with 12,234 (98.6 percent ) testing negative. Those who tested positive are either in medical isolation or are considered presumed recovered following NCDHHS guidance. More information on the facilities where mass testing has taken place can be found here.

        Temporarily closing the Johnston Correctional Institution and transferring hundreds of offenders to other prisons to free the staff for reassignment to Neuse Correctional Institution, to help with managing that facility where a mass testing operation of the 700 offenders at Neuse Correctional Institution has revealed hundreds of offenders there are infected with COVID-19 and 98 percent are asymptomatic. The staff at Neuse Correctional have been working under intense conditions for more than two weeks, when the first two offenders there tested positive for COVID-19 on April 2.</p>
